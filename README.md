# Domain_adaptation_GANs
The primary goal of this project is to develop a novel approach for adapting GANs to new domains using only a single target domain example.
Traditional domain adaptation techniques often require a significant amount of labeled data from the target domain, which can be impractical in many real-world scenarios.


- We have prepared the scripts to train new models 
  -  For training model without entities, ```sh scripts/train_OSGA.sh```
  -  For training model with entities, ```sh scripts/train_GOGA.sh```
  -  For inference, ```sh scripts/inference.sh```
